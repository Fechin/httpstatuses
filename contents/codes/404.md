The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a
current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose
that one exists. A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of
representation is temporary or permanent; the [410 (Gone)](/410) status code is
preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some
configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.

A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][2]).
