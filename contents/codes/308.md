code: 308
title: Permanent Redirect
---

The 308 Permanent Redirect status code indicates that the target resource has
been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource
ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references
to the effective request URI ([Section 5.5 of RFC7230][2]) to one or more of the
new references sent by the server, where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field
([[RFC7231], Section 7.1.2][3]) in the response containing a preferred URI
reference for the new permanent URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field
value for automatic redirection. The server's response payload usually contains
a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls ([see RFC7234, Section 4.2.2][4]).

Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)
([RFC7231, Section 6.4.2][5]), except that it does not allow changing the
request method from POST to GET.
