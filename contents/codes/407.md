The 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code is similar to
[401 (Unauthorized)](/401), but it indicates that the client needs to
authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.  The proxy MUST send a
Proxy-Authenticate header field ([Section 4.3][2]) containing a challenge
applicable to that proxy for the target resource.  The client MAY repeat the
request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization header field
([Section 4.4][3]).
