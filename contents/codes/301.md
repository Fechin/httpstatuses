The 301 (Moved Permanently) status code indicates that the target resource has
been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource
ought to use one of the enclosed URIs. Clients with link-editing capabilities
ought to automatically re-link references to the effective request URI to one or
more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a
preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI. The user agent MAY use the
Location field value for automatic redirection. The server's response payload
usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method from
POST to GET for the subsequent request. If this behavior is undesired, the
[307 (Temporary Redirect)](/307) status code can be used instead.

A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]][2]).
