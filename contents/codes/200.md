The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The payload 
sent in a 200 response depends on the request method. For the methods defined by 
this specification, the intended meaning of the payload can be summarized as:

GET a representation of the target resource

HEAD the same representation as GET, but without the representation data

POST a representation of the status of, or results obtained from, the action;

PUT, DELETE a representation of the status of the action;

OPTIONS a representation of the communications options;

TRACE a representation of the request message as received by the end server.

Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload, though an 
origin server MAY generate a payload body of zero length. If no payload is 
desired, an origin server ought to send [204 (No Content)](/204) instead.  For 
CONNECT, no payload is allowed because the successful result is a tunnel, which 
begins immediately after the 200 response header section.

A 200 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the 
method definition or explicit cache controls 
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][2]).
