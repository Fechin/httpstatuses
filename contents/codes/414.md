title: Request-URI Too Long

---

The 414 URI Too Long status code indicates that the server is refusing to
service the request because the request-target ([Section 5.3 of RFC7230][2]) is
longer than the server is willing to interpret.

This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly
converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information, when the
client has descended into a "black hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI
prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by
a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][3]).
