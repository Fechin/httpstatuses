The 405 Method Not Allowed status code indicates that the method received in
the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target
resource.

The origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405 response
containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.

A 405 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls (see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][2]).
