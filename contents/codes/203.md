The 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) status code indicates that the request
was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that of the
origin server's [200 (OK)](/200) response by a transforming proxy
([Section 5.7.2 of RFC7230][2]). This status code allows the proxy to notify
recipients when a transformation has been applied, since that knowledge might
impact later decisions regarding the content. For example, future cache
validation requests for the content might only be applicable along the same
request path (through the same proxies).

The 203 response is similar to the Warning code of 214 Transformation Applied
([Section 5.5 of RFC7234][3]), which has the advantage of being applicable to
responses with any status code.

A 203 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][4]).
